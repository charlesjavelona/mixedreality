Docs to keep track of ar/vr, my thoughts, and problem space

## Current thoughts
I see the same history repeat with ar/vr headsets. Apple will win the developer market. They generally wait for a hardware technology to mature before building an in-house team to package it for consumers. Where most of the money to be made is the software creation.

## Ideas
- Immersive liveshows to show and sell products
- Immersive concerts
- Small business creator tools
- UX to replace home monitors
